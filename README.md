# Automatic Light Controller with PIR and LDR Sensors
This repository contains the implementation and documentation of a project using an Arduino Uno R3 microcontroller to control lights automatically based on motion detection (PIR sensor) and ambient light intensity (LDR sensor).

## Overview
The project utilizes the Arduino Uno R3, a popular microcontroller platform, to achieve the following functionalities:

Automatic light activation based on motion detection using a PIR sensor.
Adjusting light operation according to ambient brightness using an LDR sensor.
Real-time sensor data processing for efficient light control.
Objectives
Implement a real-time automatic light control system using Arduino Uno R3.
Integrate PIR and LDR sensors for motion detection and light intensity measurement.
Demonstrate GPIO-based sensor and LED control.
